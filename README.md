# proxmox-exporter

This is a prometheus exporter for proxmox, it is heavily inspired by 
[prometheus-pve-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-pve/prometheus-pve-exporter)
but tries to solve [an issue where metrics where duplicated in HA clusters](https://github.com/prometheus-pve/prometheus-pve-exporter/issues/54)
